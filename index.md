Hi, I'm **Bas Doorn**. I have been working in cybersecurity for about seven years, varying from cybercrime investigations to developing secure software.  
I like to create new things that are useful for other people. For the past few years I've been working on [Chiff](https://chiff.app), an app that works as a password manager, but without the master password. Furthermore, I regularly perform as a public speaker on cybersecurity-related subjects.

Check out [about](/about) if you want to know more about me. [Resources](/resources) contains a list of different resources that interest me.

Contact details can be found below, feel free to get in touch!
